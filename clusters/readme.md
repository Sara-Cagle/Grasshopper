This folder contains clusters I have made and use throughout my projects.

* Ri via Length of Side: Calculates the radius of the incircle of the geometry based on the geometry's side length. 
* Ri via Rc: Calcualtes the radius of the incircle of the geometry based on the geometry's outer circumcircle
* Scaled Offset Circles: Creates offset circles by using the scaled component rather than the offset component (for overlapping shapes to be combined and converted to single objects)
* Scaled Offset Geometry: Creates offset geometries by using the scaled component rather than the offset component. Is built on the same logic as the above component, but instead you pass in the geometry you want to offset, including circles, instead of just a radius. This makes it more expansive than above cluster. You can later multiple different shapes.
* Create alternating Points: Creates a series of points based on a given starting X location and the desired alternating Y values. Can be set in any plane with a given Z value
* Extrude capped in Z direction: Caps and extrudes a curve in the Z direction by a given amount
* Pythagorean theorum for hypothenus: Calculates the hypotenus of a triange based on the given sides using Pythagorean theorum
