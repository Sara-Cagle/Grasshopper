Definition for creating n-sided polygons that have "slots" cut into each side such that if laser cut out of cardboard, the pieces can be interlocked together.
This definition extrudes the polygons to the given thickness such that they can be rendered in 3D (to mimic cardboard), however, the extrusion step can be skipped to get just the linework.
