A Grasshopper definition that will create a square with tabs and cutout notches with dogbones. The definition is such that you can toggle the size of the square and the desired size of the slots/tabs and the number of tabs will automatically be created.

The tabs have dogbones in them such that the design can be milled using an endmill CNC and the tabs/cutouts will be able to log together to create a cube.
