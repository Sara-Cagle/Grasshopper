Flower of life designed for laser cutting , loosely based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-So3tkFDIw)

Creates layers of rings using Anemone library and [this scaled ring cluster](https://github.com/Sara-Cagle/Grasshopper/blob/main/clusters/Scaled%20Offset%20Circles.ghcluster) I created.

Has toggleable outer ring.
